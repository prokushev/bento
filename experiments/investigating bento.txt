After long search in inet for information about bento i found oo file bento.c [LWP]. As result - Lotus Word Pro
uses bento format. Heh. Some codebase. Another source of information is Bento Specification 1.0d5 [BS].
And 2 patents. So, quest is go on.

1. Implementing base trivial functions.

Messages Operations (cmerrors)

All message constants was found in BS. Only problem is starting of constants from digits. Really this is
incorrect. After small thinking all messages was pefixed by CMERR_*. Same thing with basic types. In some
places CM_* prefix are used, no in another. As result I used CM_* in all types. Most probably it is ok.

Error message system is close to OS/2 system.

2. Try to open file (yes, lwp is bento container!)

First of all i need to determine  Magic Header to find entry point. [BS] not says nothing about real value.
But [LWP] is here. As result - Magic Header is 


0xA4 0x43 0x4D 0xA5 0x48 0x64 0x72


Search of newer filter source code gives us real constant ))

http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/lotuswordpro/source/filter/bento.hxx

#define BEN_MAGIC_BYTES "\xA4""CM""\xA5""Hdr""\xD7"

Also some code base become )

Ok. According to OO LWP filter magic header always at the end. Accprding to [BS] - header can be anywhere.
So, lets try to open container...
