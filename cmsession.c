/*

This call is used for all global initialization of the Container Manager. It must be
called before any other Container Manager routine and should only be called once. If not,
every API routine will try to exit without doing anything.

An anonymous non-NULL pointer is returned if initialization is successful. NULL is
returned for failure unless the error reporter (discussed below) aborts execution.
This routine takes as its main parameter the address of a metahandler. This metahandler
must define operations for error handling, memory allocation, and memory deallocation.
The interface to the metahandler and to the three specific handlers is
documented in Appendix B.

In addition the caller can pass a “reference constant” (refCon) as the last parameter
to this routine. It is saved in the session data. The refCon is not used by the API and can
be anything, but usually it will be a pointer to the caller's own session data.

This is basically a CMAbortContainer() for all currently open containers followed

abort execution if that is required. This call is intended to be used to abort the session
from unrecoverable errors.

All containers are closed without further writing to those containers, i.e., as if all
containers were opened for reading even when opened for writing. All memory allocated
by all the container data structures are freed (if possible) and the container close
handlers called to physically close the containers. All dynamic values currently in use are
released in an attempt to allow them to properly clean up any files and memory allocated
by their handlers. No further API calls should be done.

metahandler for this type name, if any, is returned. If there was no previous metahandler
defined, NULL is returned. The association between handlers and type names is global
within a session, rather than specific to a given container.

A metahandler will be called whenever Bento or the application needs to find out
how to perform a given operation on a container or value of this type. The metahandler
can define specific handlers for any number of different operations, potentially with
completely different interfaces. The interface to the metahandler is documented in the
section on handler interfaces.

CMOpen[New]Container() is called, so that the Container Manager can find the appropriate
metahandler for the container.

/*
This operation opens an existing Bento container.
The attributes must designate management structures for the container storage.
This attributes argument is not examined by Bento, but is simply passed to the appropriate
handler interfaces. It is intended to provide the information necessary for the
handlers to locate a specific container. Thus attributes serves as a communication
channel between the application and the Open handler. In its simplest form for a
container file it would be a pathname. For an embedded container, it would be the parent
value (CMValue), corresponding to the embedded container.

The typeName is used to find a metahandler defined for that same typeName. The
metahandler, in turn, defines the handlers for the container and thus knows how to get at
the physical container. These handers must understand the attributes provided.
The useFlags must be 0 or kCMReuseFreeSpace. 0 implies that the container is to
be open for reading only. No writes may be done. If kCMReuseFreeSpace is specified,
than both reading and writing may be done to update the container. Free space from
deleted data will be reused and overwrites of existing data may be done to change it
(subject to the container label flags, see below).

A container refnum is returned.

Note that an individual value can be opened as an embedded container. Through the
attributes, the value is passed to the handlers. This value must be typed as an embedded
container value. Embedded containers can have embedded containers which can also be
opened and read. The effect is that a tree of nested containers can be opened and read
without restriction. However, when a CMCloseContainer() is done on a parent
container, all of its descendents will also be closed.

/* This operation opens a new Bento container for writing. This is similar to opening
for reading (see documentation above) except that here a new and empty container is
opened. A minimum TOC is created along with the special TOC object 1 with its seed and
offset properties.

The resulting container can be updated.

In addition to kCMReuseFreeSpace, the useFlags may be 0, kCMConverting,
kCMUpdateByAppend, or kCMUpdateTarget.
generation is the generation number of the container; it must be
 
 1. If this
container is a copy of a previous container, the generation number should be 1 greater
than the generation number of the previous container.
containerFlags is the flag value that will be stored in the container label. No
container flags are currently defined.
If the kCMConverting flag is set in CMContainerUseMode, the physical container
is assumed to already contain a sequence of bytes that the caller wants to convert to
container format. The application uses CMDefineValueData() to create values for
objects in the bytes. All new stuff, including the TOC is written at the end of the existing
stuff. Bento will not modify the existing data.

If the kCMUpdateByAppend or kCMUpdateTarget flags are set, all updates to a
"target" container are recorded in the container being opened. Future opens of this
container, with CMOpenContainer() will apply the updates to the target to bring it "upto-
date" while it is open.

If kCMUpdateByAppend is specified, then the container is opened for update-byappend.
All updates are appended to the existing container and an additional TOC is
layered on to the end of the container when closed. Each time the container is opened and
then closed for update-by-append, the new updates and a new TOC are appended.
Whenever such a container is opened (in any mode), all the updates are applied appropriately
to the original container.

Using kCMUpdateTarget is similar to kCMUpdateByAppend, but the updates are
recorded in a new container.

In both cases the “target” container is specified in a type-dependent way, using the
CMRefCon and the “...” parameters passed to CMOpenNewContainer(). These parameters
are interpreted in exactly the same way as the corresponding parameters of
CMNewValue(); see the documentation of CMNewValue() for further details on the
“...” parameters.

A container refnum is returned.

Just as in reading, any number of embedded containers can be opened. Also
embedded containers can be opened within embedded containers to any depth. The effect
is that a tree of nested containers can be opened and written without restriction. However,
when a CMCloseContainer is done on a parent container, all of its descendents will also
be closed.

It is an error to call CMOpenNewContainer with a value that belongs to a container
that is not updatable, since that call would create an embedded container open for
writing.
